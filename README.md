# ENSF381-2024-Labs

I have published the lab instructions that I have made for the course ENSF381 (Fullstack Web Development) at the University of Calgary in winter 2024.

You are allowed to download and use the materials for self-learning only.

Any use of these materials for educational purposes requires written consent.

You can send me an email with the emails that I have provided in PDF files.

All materials are copyrighted except Lab7, which is an official React tutorial. 

If you pay for them, I can provide the source files in TeX, and you can edit them freely.

Also, please inform me via email or by making a GitHub issue of any abuse of these materials.
